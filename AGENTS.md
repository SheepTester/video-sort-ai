Prefer simple, concise code, and assume everything works. Do not do error handling or input checks. Do not install any new dependencies. Prefer modern features like `aspect-ratio`, `gap`, and the Pointer Events API.

This is an internal tool that will only be used on the latest version of Android Chrome. Design only for touch-based interactions on a modern phone screen.

Do not try to run the app locally; you cannot. Oftentimes, you inadvertently introduce changes to package-lock.json; please revert them when you finish.
